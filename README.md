**Objective**:

The objectives of a contact book application in Python typically include:

1. **Efficient Contact Management**: Allow users to add, update, view, and delete contact information easily.
2. **Data Persistence**: Ensure that contact information is saved and retrieved reliably using file-based storage or a database.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface, whether command-line, graphical, or web-based, for interacting with the contact book.
4. **Data Integrity and Security**: Implement mechanisms to validate data and protect sensitive information.
5. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle a growing number of contacts and interactions effectively.

**Key Activities:**

Certainly! Here are the key activities for a contact book application in Python:

1. **Adding Contacts**: Inputting and storing new contact details.
2. **Viewing Contacts**: Displaying a list of all stored contacts.
3. **Deleting Contacts**: Removing a contact from the list.
4. **Saving Data**: Persistently storing contact information to a file or database.
5. **Loading Data**: Retrieving and populating contact information from storage.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

A Python-based Contact Book can be built using the following technologies:

A contact book in Python can use **JSON** for simple file-based data storage and **SQLite** with **SQLAlchemy** for more robust database management. For user interfaces, **Tkinter** provides a basic GUI, while **Flask** or **Django** can be used for web-based interfaces.
